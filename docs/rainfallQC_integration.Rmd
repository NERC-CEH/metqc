# GitHub package
Public repository for the rainfallQC is here: https://github.com/NERC-CEH/RainfallQC
There is a notebook demo of how the package works here: https://github.com/Thomasjkeel/RainfallQC-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/demo/rainfallQC_demo.ipynb

# Dependencies 

Each machine will have to have a series of requirements: 
* phyton 3.8 or later
* Dependencies for the rainfallQC package ()
* R with shiny and dependencies for metqc app.

# How it will work with a shiny app: 

- Use the R reticulate package
- Create a function to automatically set up the Python environment
- when ready to use: 
```{r}


library(reticulate)

# Import the Python module
rainfallqc <- import("rainfallqc")

# Call a specific function, say `your_function_name`
result <- rainfallqc$your_function_name(arg1, arg2)

```
