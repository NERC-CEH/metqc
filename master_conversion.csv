P_12_1_1,P,tp,,Precipitation,Precipitation,"
This parameter is the accumulated liquid and frozen water, comprising rain and snow, that falls to the Earth's surface. It is the sum of large-scale precipitation and convective precipitation. Large-scale precipitation is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. Convective precipitation is generated by the convection scheme in the IFS, which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. See further information. This parameter does not include fog, dew or the precipitation that evaporates in the atmosphere before it lands at the surface of the Earth.

This parameter is the total amount of water accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box.
